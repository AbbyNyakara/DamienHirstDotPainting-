This is one of the best use cases of Object oriented programming. 

Project Goal
- Create a dot painting similar to the famous Damien Hirst Painting that sold for $19.2 Million in 2007

Modules used 
- For this project, i used the colorgram module to extract colors in jpg format. I downloaded a random picture from google and extracted the colors as tuples in a list 
- I used the turtle module to draw the painting. The dot() method was used to draw the dots and randomly selected the colors using the random.choice method.

P/S 
I had fun creating this project. Some parts of the code are commented out - the color extraction. If you need to see how that part of the code executes, feel free to uncomment
and explore
